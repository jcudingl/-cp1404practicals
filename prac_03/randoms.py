# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# 5.
# The smallest number could have seen is 5, largest is 20.

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# 5.
# The smallest number could have seen is 3, largest is 9.
# No. The result only could have been odd number from 3 to 9.

# What did you see on line 3?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# 4.700498670772694
# The smallest number could have seen is 2.5, largest is close to, but not exactly, 5.5.
